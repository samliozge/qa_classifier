Question Classification with Deep Neural Networks 

Question classification is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
In this study, I compared traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and 
gated unit Recurrent Neural Networks which are Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to classify the questions with the purpose of analysing vanishing gradient effect
The results showed that the experiments with unit gates RNNs yielded the state-of-the-art performance to 
have a better accuracy than traditional RNN for the question classification challenge. Following the accuracies of 
LSTM and GRU, 0.88 and 0.89 overcome the traditional RNN accuracy of 0.78
